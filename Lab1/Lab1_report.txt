Title:
Lab 1: Intro to Logic with Multimedia Logic
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
The purpose of this lab is to learn how to use MML and get familiar with logic gates and applying the 
knowledge to the lab.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedure:
For the warm up, I used the PDF given to us and followed the instructions. For Part B, I copied exactly how it was
given to us. For Part C, I took the sum of products and focused on the values that were true. Then, I mapped out the
design of the circuits using various logic gates. I used the invert, OR, and XOR logic gates. I wrote down the values 
that I got from the logic gates and tested it out with the LED. For Part D, I wrote down the logic into sentences. If
the guesser has a matching answer to the RNG, then the third LED will light up. I wrote a bunch of if statements. Since
the values of the switches are based on user input, I had to come up with different results. I used the AND logic
for saying that if the guesser and the random number generator have matching answers, then the LED will light up.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What Went Wrong Or What Were the Challenges?:
My challenges was mostly from Part D. I was not neat in my work while making the circuits with the program, so I ended
up getting inverted results. I also forgot to use XNOR. I got used to drawing the plan of the circuit without the dot to
signiify XNOR that on the program I used XOR and so when my switches were put to 1 and 1 and the
values of the two LEDs from the RNG were set to 1 and 1, the LED did not light up, but when the switches were set to 0 and
0, the LED lit up saying that it was right when it should not have. I did not connect the wires fromt the RNG to the XNOR
and LED lights correctly. A TA had to tell me to clean up my lab, so I labeled and rearranged it. I got lost in keeping 
track of the wires. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other information (Answer any question(s) posted in the assignment):
-If I didn't have a digital display, I would have made one with binary and an LED light. The LED light would represent
either a 1 or a 0. If the light is on, then the value is 1. If the light is off, then the value is 0. I would have made
almost exactly like Part D. Although we were instructed to use one LED to see if the guesser was right, having two more
let me know the values of the RNG, making it easier to check my work.

-I think that the random number generator works by having multiple inputs and outputs. The input must connect to some
sort of device that will activate the random number generator. I think that the wires are connected in a way that the 
certain input will correlate with a certain output.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion:
Messing around with MML was interesting and sometimes stressful. I found out I will probably br using a mouse for the
next lab. It was easy for me to overthink the assignment, but I eventually figured it out after getting help from the 
TAs. Part C involved knowledge from CE16 because of the Sum of Products and truth tables, so it was easy. Part D 
allows the guesser to input their guess using the switches and knowing what the RNG chose with the 2 other LEDs.

EXTRA:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The lab would have been easier if the professor went over the material when I started it because I started early. Also,
it would have been better if the instructions for Part D was clearer because I had to ask someone how to get a push-
button switch. Also, I did not know how to get XNOR until a TA showed me that I needed to double click XOR to get it.
