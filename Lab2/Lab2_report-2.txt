Title:Lab 2: Adding and Subtracting
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
The purpose of this lab is to get a feel on using sequential and combinational logic when adding and subtracting a
sequence of numbers. Also, the purpose was to implement our knowledge from homework one in adding and subtracing 
numbers to a lab.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedure:
For this lab, we were supposed to make each component separately on different pages and test them out in parts to 
see if all of the components function properly. For part 1, I looked at the attached Starter_Parts and copied and pasted
the D flip flops that were given to us six times to represent 6 bits even though we only needed 4 bits. For part 2, I 
copied and pasted the given input/keyboard attached to flip flops from the Starter_Parts. For part 3, I made a full adder
but it was too complicated, so I tried simplifying it with the Sum of Products. I tested out one to check the logic and 
used LED lights. I copied one 5 more times to represent 6 bits. I didn't connect the last carryout because of 
overflow. For part 4, I used 6 2:1 muxes to represent the bits, but I grounded the 2 MSB since we only want 4 bits. To make 
the inverter, I attached a switch to the full adder and the switch to represent subtraction and addition. Afterwards, I 
connected everything with signal senders and receivers. I followed the flow chart, so I started to replace the switches
and LED lights with the receivers and sendres (except for the first page parts because of user input). Since the lab was 
out of order, I had to draw everything out on a piece of paper as a whole without using signal senders and receivers to 
see exactly where everything should go. For my logic, I wrote out sentences to make things seem clearer. Since the default
setting of the switches were 0, I set 0 to addition and 1 to subtraction since we are already used to adding. For 
subtraction, I used 2's complement because it is just adding one. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What Went Wrong Or What Were the Challenges?:
My challenge was mostly connecting everything. I understood the assignment, but the fact that the components were
on separate pages and that they were out of order from the chart confused me, which was why I had to draw 
everything out by hand. Also, my challenge was name choice. I called my 2 MSBs  labels that end with 0 and 1, which
confused myself because 0 and 1 would be the LSBs for position. I should have switched the names, but I eventually 
was able to pull through. When I first tested it out after connecting everything, my program would not work properly.
At first, I kept getting undefined because I did not ground my muxes correctly. I double-checked and realized that the
ground was set to 1 instead of 0. My next problem was that I kept getting F as a result. I used the tool in the program
that tells me the output to find the source of the problem. My logic got messed up in the mux because I forgot to set 
one of receivers for the Key input to inverse and the other one to not inverted. Overall, I believe the main problem was 
the mux in the end. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other information (Answer any question(s) posted in the assignment):
-As I said earlier, the issues in building the circuit were setting up the mux and connecting everything. I redid my
logic and double-checked everything to fix the problems. The lab was pretty much self-explanatory. Choosing the names 
by making the first 2 MSBs 0 and 1 instead of 5 and 4 was a mistake. I did not add the optiont to invert in the mux which 
was why I kept getting F as an output. I used LED lights to debug my problems, which helped because I knew what the 
problem was right away.

-When I inputted 1-2, I got 3F as a result. 3F is 63 in decimal, but 1-2 in decimal is -1. I think that it is wonky because the 
program is only for unsigned numbers. 2-3 got C as an output. When I added F+E, I got the haxadeceimal version of 29, which is 
still correct since F is 15 ans E is 14. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion:
Messing around with MML was interesting and sometimes stressful. I found out I will probably br using a mouse for the
next lab. It was easy for me to overthink the assignment, but I eventually figured it out after getting help from the 
TAs. Part C involved knowledge from CE16 because of the Sum of Products and truth tables, so it was easy. Part D 
allows the guesser to input their guess using the switches and knowing what the RNG chose with the 2 other LEDs.

EXTRA:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The lab would have been better if there was a more in-depth description of what the components do. Also, it would have been
nicer if the parts were in order.
